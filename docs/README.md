# Introduction

Snowbridge is a general-purpose, trustless, and decentralized bridge between Polkadot and Ethereum. It is part of the Polkadot SDK and exists as a system bridge for Polkadot. Ethereum contracts and other off-chain infrastructure can be found in our [Github repository](https://github.com/snowfork/snowbridge).

Key features that set Snowbridge apart from other bridges:

* Owned by the Polkadot community. We do not offer a token.
* Trustless, decentralised, no multisigs
* Integrated with Polkadot Hub and many parachains

The Snowbridge team continues to develop new features and enhance the bridge. For updates on Snowbridge, follow our [account on X](https://x.com/_snowbridge).
