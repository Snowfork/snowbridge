# On Trustlessness

In the blockchain space, most applications are driven by or augmented with financial use cases. This means that end users are giving up some control over their finances to whatever system they use. By giving up this control, they trust that the systems they use will protect their funds and stick to the expectations they have about how the system functions.

We define a trustless system as a system in which the end user does not need to trust any participants or group of participants in the system in order to maintain protection of their funds and expectations of functionality. They only need to trust the protocols, mathematics, cryptography, code and economics.

This can be achieved in various ways. The important thing here is for safety of user funds and expectations to be preserved, irrespective of the participants in the system.

100% trustlessness cannot always be guaranteed - there always needs to be some set of basic assumptions that must be taken on, (eg: like assuming that an EMP wont hit the earth and wipe out all digital data). Snowbridge caters to a set of assumptions that will be mostly uncontroversial and acceptable by the community.
