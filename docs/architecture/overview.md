# Overview

Snowbridge provides a secure point-to-point bridge between the BridgeHub parachain and our Gateway contract on Ethereum.

By leveraging Polkadot's native XCMP messaging protocol, our bridge allows any arbitrary Polkadot parachain to communicate with Ethereum via BridgeHub. More specifically, parachains will use the bridge by sending XCM instructions to BridgeHub.
